        <h1>Chapter 8: <strong>CSS3 Transforms and Transitions</strong></h1>
        <h2>Transforms</h2>
        <h2>Translate</h2>

            <p>Translation functions allow you to move elements left, right, up, or down. 
            These functions are similar to the behavior of position: relative; 
            when declaring top and left, moving elements up and down or left and right 
            along the x and y axes</p>
            <pre>transform: translate(45px, -45px);</pre>
            <p>To move an element vertically or horizontally, you can use the translatex or translatey</p>
    
        <h2>Scaling</h2>
                <p>The scale(x,y) function scales an element by the defined factors horizontally 
                    then vertically. If only one value is provided, it will be used for both the x and y values, 
                    growing or shrinking your element or pseudo-element while maintaining the original aspect ratio</p>
                <pre>transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);</pre>
                <p>As with translate, you can also use the scaleX(x) or scaleY(y) functions. 
                    These functions will scale only the horizontal dimensions or only the vertical dimensions respectively.</p>
                    <p>A scaled element will grow outwards from or shrink inwards towards its center</p>

        <h2>Rotation</h2>
                <p>The rotate() function rotates an element around the point of origin by a specified angle value</p>
                <pre>transform: rotate(10deg)</pre>

        <h2>Skew</h2>
                <p>The skew(x,y) function specifies a skew along the x and y axes. As you’d expect,
                     the x specifies the skew on the x axis, and the y specifies the skew on the y axis. 
                     If the second parameter is omitted, the skew will only occur on the x axis</p>
                <pre>transform: skew(15deg, 4deg);</pre>
                <p><strong>As with translate and scale, there are axis-specific versions of the skew transform: skewX() and skewY()</strong></p>
        <h2>Note:</h2>
                <p> All of these properties can be used together:</p>
                <pre>transform: rotate(10deg) translateX(40px) scale(1.5);</pre>
        <h2>Transitions</h2>
                <p>Transitions allow the values of CSS properties to change over time, essentially providing simple animations</p>
                <p>Here are the steps to create a simple transition using only CSS:</p>

                <ul>

                    <li>Declare the original state of the element in the default style declaration.</li>

                   <li> Declare the final state of your transitioned element; for example, a :hover state.</li>

                    <li>Include the transition functions in your default style declaration using the transition properties, including: 
                    transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. 
                    We’ll look at each of these and how they work shortly.</li>

                </ul>

                <pre>transition-property: transform, color;</pre>
            <h3>The transition-duration Property</h3>
            <p>The transition-duration property sets how long the transition will take: the duration of time it takes to go from the default state to the transitioned state.
                 You can specify this either in seconds (s) or milliseconds (ms).</p>
                 <pre>transition-duration: 0.2s; // that is 200 milliseconds (200ms</pre>
            <h3>The transition-timing-function Property</h3>
            <p>The transition-timing-function lets you control the pace of the transition in even more granular detail. 
                Do you want your animation to start off slow and become faster, start off fast and end slower, advance at an even keel, or some other variation?</p>
                <p>The most common timing functions include the key terms:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>ease: is the default, it has a slow start, then it speeds up, and ends slowly </li>
                    <li>linear: creates a transition that animates at a constant speed</li>
                    <li>ease-in: creates a transition that is slow to start but gains speed, then stops abruptly.</li>
                    <li>ease-out: opposite of ease-in, ease-out, starts at full speed, then slows progressively as it reaches the conclusion of the transition</li>
                    <li>ease-in-out: is similar to ease, but accelerates more sharply at the beginning.</li>
                </ul> 
                <p>The best way to familiarize yourself with them is to play around and try them all</p>
                <pre>transition-timing-function: ease-out;</pre>

            <h3>The transition Shorthand Property</h3>
            <p>With four transition properties and a vendor prefix, you could wind up with eight lines of CSS for a single transition</p>
            <pre>transition-property: transform; 
                transition-duration: 0.2s;  
                transition-timing-function: ease-out;
                transition-delay: 50ms;</pre>
                <p>Here is the shorthand of the above</p>
                <pre>transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;</pre>
            <h3>Multiple Transitions</h3>
            <p>The transition properties allow for multiple transitions in one call.Instead of defining this way:</p>
            <pre>transition-property: transform, color; 
                transition-duration: 0.2s, 0.1s;  
                transition-timing-function: ease-out, linear;
                transition-delay: 50ms;</pre>
                <p>you could do this instead:</p>
                <pre>transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms, color 0.1s linear 50ms;</pre>

            <p>If you want to change both properties at the same rate and delay, 
                you can include both property names or—since you are transitioning all the properties listed in the hover state anyway—you can employ the all keyword.<br><br>

                When using the all keyword, all the properties transition at the same rate, speed, and delay:</p>
                <pre>transition: all 0.2s ease-out 50ms; </pre>

        <h2>Animations</h2>
        <p>CSS animations, unlike transitions, allow you to control each step of an animation via keyframes.</p>
        <p>A keyframe is a snapshot that defines a starting or end point of any smooth transition. 
            With CSS transitions, we’re essentially limited to defining a first and a last keyframe. 
            CSS animations allow us to add any number of keyframes in between, to guide our animation in more complex ways.</p>

        <p>To create an animation, use the <strong>@keyframes</strong> rule for IE10+ and FF16+. Include <strong>@-webkit-keyframes</strong> for all WebKit implementations followed by a name of your choosing, which will serve as the identifier for the animation. Then, you can specify your keyframes</p>
            <p>For an animation called myAnimation, the @keyframes rule would look like this:</p>
            <pre>
                @-webkit-keyframes myAnimation { 
                    /* put animation keyframes here */
                }
                @keyframes myAnimation { 
                    /* put animation keyframes here */
                }
            </pre>

            <p>Do not quote the animation name.<br>

                Each keyframe looks like its own nested CSS declaration block. Instead of a traditional selector, 
                though, you use a percentage value, or a comma-separated list of percentage values. <br>
                There are two keyterms― from and to ―which evaluate to 0% and 100% respectively. These values specify how far along the animation each keyframe is located.</p>


            <pre>
                @keyframes moveRight { 
                    from {
                    transform: translateX(-50%);
                    }
                    to {
                    transform: translateX(50%);
                    }
                }
                
                @keyframes appearDisappear { 
                    0%, 100% {
                    opacity: 0;
                    }
                    20%, 80% {
                    opacity: 1;
                    }
                }
                
                @keyframes bgMove {
                    100% {
                    background-position: 120% 0;
                    }
                }
            </pre>

            <h3>Animation Properties</h3>
            <pre>animation-name: appearDisappear;
                animation-duration:
            </pre>
            <p>animation-duration property defines the length of time (in seconds or milliseconds) an animation takes to complete one iteration (all the way through, from 0% to 100%)
        <h3>animation-timing-function</h3>
        <p>Like the transition-timing-function property, the animation-timing-function determines how the animation will progress over its duration</p>
        <p>The options are the same as for transition-timing-function: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, 
            a developer-defined cubic-bezier() function, step-start, step-end, or a developer-defined number of steps with the steps(number, direction) function:</p>
            <pre>
                animation-timing-function: linear;
            </pre>
