        <h3My Notes:</h3>
        <p> The JavaScript object is a collection of key-value pairs, similar to a map, dictionary, or hash-table in other programming languages. Anything that is not a JS primitive is an Object.
            </p>
          <ul>
              <li>An Object is a collection of properties.</li>
              <li>A Property is a key-value pair that contains a name and a value.</li>
                <li>A Property Name is a unique value that can be coerced to a string that points to a value.</li>
                <li>A Property Value can be any value, including other objects or functions, that associated with the name/key.</li>
            </ul>
       <p> JavaScript uses the keywords <strong>const</strong> and <strong>let</strong> to declare variables. <br>
           The keyword <strong>const</strong> is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value, whereas <strong>let</strong> is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.</p>
       <p>There are two types of scope in JavaScript.These are:
<ul>
    <li> Global scope — Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. 
        A code block simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). if statement, loops, function are examples of structures that create a code block. <br>
        A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.</li>
    <li> Local Scope — Local scope contains things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope. A local variable is only accessible where it’s declared.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p> When writing your codes it is good to use functions for reasons such as:
        <ul>
            <li>To improve the readability of code.</li>
            <li>Improves the reusability of the code, the same function can be used in any program rather than writing the same code from scratch.</li>
            <li>Debugging of the code would be easier if you use functions, as errors are easy to be traced.</li>
    </ul></p>
    <p> The two most used functions are function declaration and function expression<br>
            Function declaration example:<br>
                 function hello(){ console.log('Hello World!');} <br><br>

            Function expression example: <br>
                const goodbye = function(){ console.log('Goodbye World!'); };
    </p>
    <p> There is another syntax used to declare a function and it is called <strong>arrow</strong>. These make declaring functions much more succinct by using less verbose syntax.
Arrow functions can be identified by the 'arrow' symbol,<mark> => </mark> that gives them their name</p>
