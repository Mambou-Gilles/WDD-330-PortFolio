        <h2>WDD 330: Portfolio Week 1</h2>
         
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <p> I have not taken much note while reading thections on Localstorage in <strong><mark>Doing Stuff with Web Things</mark></strong> I was mostly focusing on the exercises found in there. 
            Click on the link below to be directed to the exercise page.<br>
            <a href="exercise.html">CLICK HERE</a></p>
        <p>About the video <strong><mark>Master Mobile UX</mark></strong>, I learned that if one doesn't think correctly, he/she is going to have terrible experience for their users.<br>
               There are different ranges of devices with different screen sizes, different resolutions and when we build something, 
                we should always take account of its viewability across all the devices.<br><br>
            <b>-</b> Most people do what's called "RESPONSIVE RETROFITTING" which is to take what you have and make it work on Mobile first, 
                in other word we should start small and scale up.</p>
            <h4> Benefits and disadvantages of Retrofitting:</h4>
            <h4>Advantages:</h4> 
            <ul>
                <li>Cheaper and faster than ground up and re-writing,/li>
                <li>Better mobile experience than desktop only,</li>
                <li>provides best experience across many devices,</li>
                <li>Address constraints of mobile size/bandwidth,
                <li>Future friendly and ready for growth.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4>Disadvantages:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Doesn't address touch interaction issues,</li>
                <li>Doesn't address screen real estate issues,</li>
                <li>Time consuming and costly for full rebuild.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4> Ways to improve UX by understanding users:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li> Reachability - Be there for the users</li>
                <li>Be useful</li>
                <li>Be Quick</li>
                <li>Make it simple for the users</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Lastly, One should always research before advertizing something.We cannot assume how people use their mobile, but not understanding how they truly use a device can really hurt.</p>
            
            <h3>Question:</h3>
            <p> What is the difference between localStorage and SessionStorage?</p>
